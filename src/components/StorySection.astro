          The Bobby Grier Legacy

          <p>
            In 1956, Bobby Grier made history as the first African American to play in the Sugar Bowl,
            breaking racial barriers in one of college football's most prestigious games. His courage
            on the field that day changed the course of American sports history forever.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grier's stand against discrimination wasn't just about football—it was about dignity,
            equality, and the power of one person to spark change. His legacy reminds us that
            every play matters, every voice counts, and every day is an opportunity to make history.
          </p>
          <p class="font-display font-bold text-primary text-lg">
            Without Bobby Grier, there is no game. Without courage, there is no change.
          </p>
          <p>
