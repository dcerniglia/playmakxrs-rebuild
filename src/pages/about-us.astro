        <p>
          Since our founding, Playmakxrs Global™ has been committed to honoring the legacy of
          Bobby Grier—the first African American to play in the Sugar Bowl. His courage in 1956
          wasn't just about football; it was about breaking barriers, demanding equality, and
          proving that one person's stand can change history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, we continue that mission by providing a platform for athletes, creators, and
          community leaders to share their stories, access NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) opportunities,
          participate in exclusive events, and make a tangible impact in their communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          From exclusive storytelling to advocacy for player rights, we're building a movement
          that celebrates the plays that matter—both on and off the field.
